# GenoBot Journal Entry  
 
## Entry 1  
**Entry Date: 20th December 2022**  
First steps towards creating Geno have been made as Geno now exists on the server and is capable of responding to the basic calls. It was deemed as challenging as contraray to the tutorial videos which used an external IDE (ripl.it), I made it clear that I wamted to use VS Code such that I can be capable of having a more *authentic* path (and therefore a path full of challenges and inconveniences and lots of figuring out )  
A prominent challenge was dealing with the token; doing it in VS code required the usage of the ` dot env ` package such that it can read the environment variables and to obtain the token for the bot to run.  
An interesting observation is that the names of the functions cannot be changed which makes me wonder if they are part of the Discord API (therefore they must have a consistent nomenclature)  
  
Key aspects to focus for next time:<ul>  
<li>Refer the Documentation such that you can better understand the functions and keywords involved and therefore help better plan future improvments. </li>
<li>Refer to the Google Calender (if any) to help connect the Bot to Google Calender such that we can use the Bot to plan events.</li>  
<li>Create a Documentation and remain consistent with it. </li></ul>
